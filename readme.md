# Pred Item Cleaner

I didn't like how their items were saved so I made this to turn their items into ones I could work with

# How to use

1. Dump the items (not going to tell you how to do that)
2. Store the items in a folder next to src called data/items
```
    src/
    data/
        items/
            ...
```
3. Run `cargo run`
